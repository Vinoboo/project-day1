    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>The prologue of <b>Romeo and Juliet</b> calls the title characters <strong>“star-crossed lovers”</strong>—and the stars do seem to conspire against these young lovers.

        <i>Romeo is a Montague</i>i, and <i>Juliet a Capulet</i>i. Their families are enmeshed in a feud, but the moment they meet—when Romeo and his friends attend a party at Juliet’s house in disguise—the two fall in love and quickly decide that they want to be married.</p>
    <h3>Romeo and juliet history</h3>
    <p>Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. The plot is based on an Italian tale written by Matteo Bandello and translated into verse as The <u>Tragical History</u> of Romeus and Juliet by<i> Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567.</i></p>
    <h3>Moral of story</h3>
    <p>All tragic heros have a tragic flaw, and Romeo's is summed up by the advice that <u>Friar Lawrence</u> gives him (and which he ignores): <b>"Wisely and slow; they stumble who run fast.</b>" Essentially, Romeo and Juliet teaches us not to make rash decisions based on passion, but to be patient and rational.</p>
